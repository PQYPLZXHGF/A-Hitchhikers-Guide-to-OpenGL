# A Hitchhiker's Guide to OpenGL

I've written this guide as part of teaching the graphics lab courses at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). OpenGL 4 can be difficult to get started with, and even though there are some good tutorials and reference resources, I wasn't happy with the way they explained the library. The result is a guide whose primary focus is getting a few triangles to draw on screen.
